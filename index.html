    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Reading Books</h2>
    <p>My favorite hobby is reading books. My favorite book is the Artemis Fowl series, more specifically the first book. This book is basically a fairy tale, but in real life. Artemis Fowl is a criminal mastermind at the young age of 12 years old. He gets involved with things that mostly older criminals get involved with. Recently, he's learned that fairy folk do indeed exist. He researched extensively about it and soon enough, he found a fairy of his own. He asks the fairy for her book that every fairy has and bribes her with things that the fairy wants/needs. Artemis takes photos of everything in the book and emails it to his computer. The adventures begin from there. He captures another fairy named Holly Short and bribes the fairy council for a lot of gold to get her back.</p>

This book is a "Witty and exciting series start with irresistble antihero" according to <a href="https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews/artemis-fowl-book-1">commonsensemedia.org</a>.
